# StageClientAssessments

I was given an assignment by my internship to make an anagram function and a front end that communicates with the Rijksmuseum API.
This project is a combination of them both.


On the landing page you get can choose between assignment 1 and 2
- assignment 1: Gives you the option to give a few words as input and returns an anagram.
- assignment 2: is a master list with details combined in 1 page with a filter that runs get requests.

I did run in some issues while programming and one of them was that the collection details API is broken, it keeps giving me error 500.
Although I still got a detail page for each art object, its less then it should have been. 
Their own example in their documentation doesn’t even work.

But outside of issues like that most things went smooth.
